# pycolormap

A self-contained colormap library for Python.

# Why Not Matplotlib?

If you do not mind using Matplotlib, please use it (<https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html>) and just forget this library.

If you do not want to use Matplotlib for some reasons, then this library is probably useful.

# Available Colormaps

## Matplotlib

- Magma
- Inferno
- Plasma
- Viridis

These colormaps are designed to be perceptually uniform (even in black-and-white printing) and friendly to colorblindness.

The original colormaps are released under CC0 by Nathaniel J. Smith, Stefan van der Walt, and (in the case of viridis) Eric Firing: https://github.com/BIDS/colormap/blob/master/colormaps.py.

This colormap is designed to mimic the color scheme used in GitHub contributions visualization.
