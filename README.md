# pycolormap

A self-contained colormap library for Python.

# Why Not Matplotlib?

If you do not mind using Matplotlib, please use it (<https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html>) and just forget this library.

If you do not want to use Matplotlib for some reasons, then this library is probably useful.

# Available Colormaps

## Matplotlib

| Name       | Sample                         |
|:----------:|:------------------------------:|
| `magma`    | ![](docs/samples/magma.png)    |
| `inferno`  | ![](docs/samples/inferno.png)  |
| `plasma`   | ![](docs/samples/plasma.png)   |
| `viridis`  | ![](docs/samples/viridis.png)  |

These colormaps are designed to be perceptually uniform (even in black-and-white printing) and friendly to colorblindness.

The original colormaps are released under CC0 by Nathaniel J. Smith, Stefan van der Walt, and (in the case of viridis) Eric Firing: https://github.com/BIDS/colormap/blob/master/colormaps.py.

This colormap is designed to mimic the color scheme used in GitHub contributions visualization.
