# pycolormap
[WIP] A self-contained colormap library for Python

# Available Colormaps

## Matplotlib

These colormaps are designed to be perceptually uniform (even in black-and-white printing) and friendly to colorblindness.

The original colormaps are released under CC0 by Nathaniel J. Smith, Stefan van der Walt, and (in the case of viridis) Eric Firing: https://github.com/BIDS/colormap/blob/master/colormaps.py.

## GitHub

This colormap is designed to mimic the color scheme used in GitHub contributions visualization.
